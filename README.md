# Climate_Data_Project
Data Project on Climate Data for the AAE 718 Data Science Course 

Project Description:
We will be using the climate data from The National Centers for Environmental Information for this project. These datasets are made available by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratoin. This is a world wide data
set, so you can more than likely find data from your home region.
Here are the data requirements:
 You need data from at least 4 weather stations
 You need at least 10 years of data from each station
Your goal is to ask and answer an interesting question using the data. I want a written report that
provides motivation for your question, graphs that help analyze your question, and written analysis. The
style should be that of a research paper,
