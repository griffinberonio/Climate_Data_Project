# Climate Data Project

Data Project on Climate Data for the AAE 718 Data Science Course 

# Project Description:

We will be using the climate data from The National Centers for Environmental Information for this project. These datasets are made available by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratoin. This is a world wide data
set, so you can more than likely find data from your home region.
Here are the data requirements:
 You need data from at least 4 weather stations
 You need at least 10 years of data from each station
Your goal is to ask and answer an interesting question using the data. I want a written report that
provides motivation for your question, graphs that help analyze your question, and written analysis. The
style should be that of a research paper,

# Project Info:

The code in the python file is a series of functions that are independently runnable using either a jupyter notebook or by uncommenting the print statements in the if __name__ == "__main__" section at the bottom of the file to run functions in the vscode terminal. 

The Function Walk traverses the individual location directories that have the .csv files for each year. It merges these files into one master datafile which I stored in a different directory and referenced as the main path for all of the functions. 

**The data directories can be accessed [using this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AKGFHM2kZYE0S4kKa-HxaBokoiR6LCMJ?usp=drive_link).**
